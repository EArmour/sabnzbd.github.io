<p>For each download job you can set post-processing options. While the download is still in the queue, you can change them on-the-fly.</p>

            <td><code>Download</code></td>
            <td>No post-processing at all. Just download all the files (including all PAR2) and move them to the final folder. The user has to do all post-processing manually.</td>

            <td>Download all files, do a PAR2 verification and unpack the files. The final folder will also include the RAR and ZIP files.</td>
